#' Load IEA data from an extended enegy balances csv file
#'
#' This function reads an IEA extended energy balances file and
#' converts it to a data frame with appropriately-labelled columns.
#' One of `iea_file` or `text` must be specified, but not both.
#' The first line of `iea_file` or `text`
#' is expected to start with `expected_start_1st_line`, and
#' the second line is expected to start with `expected_2nd_line_start`, and
#' it may have any number of commas appended.
#' (The extra commas might come from opening and re-saving the file in Excel.)
#' If those conditions are not met, execution is halted, and
#' an error message is given.
#' 
#' This function is designed to work even as more years are added
#' in columns at the right of `.iea_file`, 
#' because column names in the output are constructed from the first two lines of `iea_file` 
#' (which contain years and country, flow, product information).
#' 
#' The IEA data have indicators for 
#' not applicable values ("`x`") and for
#' unavailable values ("`..`"). 
#' (See "World Energy Balances: Database Documentation (2018 edition)" at
#' <http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/worldbal_documentation.pdf>.)
#' `R` has three concepts that could be used for "`x`" and "`..`":
#' `0` would indicate value known to be zero.
#' `NULL` would indicate an undefined value.
#' `NA` would indicate a value that is unavailable.
#' In theory, mapping from the IEA's indicators to `R` should proceed as follows:
#' "`..`" (unavailable) in the IEA data would be converted to `NA` in `R`.
#' "`x`" (not applicable) in the IEA data would be converted to `0` in `R`.
#' "`NULL`" would not be used.
#' However, the IEA are not consistent with their coding. 
#' In some places "`..`" is used for not applicable values
#' (e.g., World Anthracite supply in 1971). 
#' World Anthracite supply in 1971 is actually not applicable, because Anthracite was
#' classified under "Hard coal (if no detail)" in 1971.
#' On the other hand, "`..`" is used for data in the most recent year 
#' when those data have not yet been incorporated into the database. 
#' In the face of IEAâ€™s inconsistencies, 
#' the only rational way to proceed is to convert 
#' both "`x`" and "`..`" to "`0`"
#' in this function.
#' 
#' The data frame returned from this function is not ready to be used in R, 
#' because rows are not unique.
#' To further prepre the data frame for use, call `augment_iea_data()`,
#' passing the output of this function in the `.iea_df` argument of `augment_iea_data()`.
#'
#' @param .iea_file a string containing the path to a .csv file of extended energy balances from the IEA
#' @param text a character string that can be parsed as IEA extended energy balances. 
#'        (This argument is useful for testing.)
#' @param expected_1st_line_start the expected start of the first line of `iea_file`. Default is "`,,TIME`".
#' @param expected_2nd_line_start the expected start of the second line of `iea_file`. Default is "`COUNTRY,FLOW,PRODUCT`".
#' @param year_colname_pattern a regex that identifies columns with year titles. 
#'        Default is "`^\\d*$`" which identifies columns whose names are exclusively digits.
#' @param missing_data a string that identifies missing data. Default is "`..`".
#'        Entries of "`missing_data`" are coded as `0`` in output.
#' @param not_applicable_data a string that identifies not-applicable data.
#'        Entries of "`not_applicable_data`" are coded as `0` in output.

#' Augment an IEA data frame
#' 
#' This function prepares an IEA data frame created by [iea_df()] for use in R.
#' 
#' This function solves several problems.
#' The first problem is that metadata in the `COUNTRY`, `FLOW`, and `PRODUCT`
#' columns of an IEA data table are not unique.
#' To solve this problem, two additional columns are added: `Ledger.side` and `Flow.aggregation.point`.
#' `Ledger.side` can be one of "`Supply`" or "`Consumption`", corresponding to the top or bottom of the IEA's tables, respectively.
#' `Flow.aggregation.point` indicates the next level of aggregation for these data. 
#' `Flow.aggregation.point` can be one of 
#' "`Total primary energy supply`", "`Transformation processes`", "`Energy industry own use`", or "`TFC compare`"
#' on the `Supply` side of the ledger.
#' On the `Consumption` side of the ledger, `Flow.aggregation.point` can be one of 
#' "`Industry`", "`Transport`", "`Other`", or "`Non-energy use`".
#' 
#' The second problem this function solves is that energy type and units are not specified in IEA data.
#' An `Energy.type` column is added with the value of `energy_type_val`. 
#' (Default is `E`, for energy, as opposed to `X`, which would be exergy.)
#' A `Units` column is added with the value of `units_val`.
#' (Default is `ktoe`, although any string can be specified in `units_val`.)
#' 
#' Note that this function decides where to divide `Supply` from `Consumption`. 
#' To do so, it first looks for rows in which `Flow` is "`Losses`".
#' The last "`Losses`" row is the last row of the `Supply` side of the ledger. 
#' If "`Losses`" rows are not found, the function looks for rows in which `Flow` is "`Total final consumption`".
#' The first "`Total final consumption`" row is the first row of the `Consumption` side of the ledger.
#' If neither "`Losses`" nor "`Total final consumption`" `Flow`s are present, 
#' an error is generated.
#'
#' @param .iea_df a data frame produced by the [iea_df()] function
#' @param country the name of the country column. Default is "`Country`".
#' @param ledger_side the name of the ledger side column. Default is "`Ledger.side`".
#' @param flow_aggregation_point the name of the flow aggregation point column. Default is "`Flow.aggregation.point`".
#' @param energy_type the name of the energy type column to be added to `.iea_df`. Default is "`Energy.type`.
#' @param energy_type_val the value to put in the `energy_type` column. Default is "`E`".
#' @param units the name of the units column to be added to `.iea_df`. Default is "`Units`".
#' @param units_val the value to put in the `units` column. Default is "`ktoe`" for kilotons of oil equivalent.
#' @param supply the string that identifies supply `Ledger.side`. Default is "`Supply`".
#' @param consumption the string that identifies consumption `Ledger.side`. Default is "`Consumption`".
#' @param tpes the string that identifies total primary energy supply `Flow.aggregation.point`. Default is "`Total primary energy supply`.
#' @param tpes_flows a vector of strings that give flows that are aggregated to `Total primary energy supply`. 
#' @param tfc_compare a string that identifies the `TFC compare` flow aggregation point. Default is `TFC compare`.
#' @param tfc_compare_flows a vector of strings that give `Flow`s that are aggregated to `TFC compare`.
#' @param losses the string that indicates losses in the `Flow` column. Default is "`Losses`".
#' @param transformation_processes the string that indicates transformation processes in the `Flow` column. Default is "`Transformation processes`".
#' @param tp_flows_suffix the suffix for transformation processes in the `Flow` column. Default is "`(transf.)`".
#' @param nstp_flows_suffix the suffix for non-specified transformation processes in the `Flow` column. Default is "`(transformation)`".
#' @param eoiu the string that identifies energy industry own use in the `Flow` column. Default is "`Energy industry own use`".
#' @param eiou_flows_suffix the suffix for energy industry own use in the `Flow` column. Default is "`(energy)`".
#' @param tfc the string that identifies total final consumption in the `Flow` column. Default is "`Total final consumption`".
#' @param tfc_flows a vector of strings that give total final consumption in the `Flow` column.
#' @param industry a string that names the industry `Flow.aggregation.point`. Default is "`Industry`".
#' @param industry_flows a vector of strings representing `Flow`s to be aggregated in the `Industry` `Flow.aggregation.point`. 
#' @param transport a string that names the transport `Flow.aggregation.point`. Default is "`Transport`".
#' @param transport_flows a vector of strings representing `Flow`s to be aggregated in the `Transport` `Flow.aggregation.point`. 
#' @param other a string that names the other `Flow.aggregation.point`. Default is "`Other`".
#' @param other_flows a vector of strings representing `Flow`s to be aggregated in the `Other` `Flow.aggregation.point`. 
#' @param non_energy a string that names the non-energy `Flow.aggregation.point`. Default is "`Non-energy use`".
#' @param non_energy_prefix a string prefix for `Flow`s to be aggregated in the `Non-energy use` `Flow.aggregation.point`. 
#' @param electricity_output a string that names the electricity output `Flow`. Default is "`Electricity output (GWh)`". 
#' @param electricity_output_flows_prefix a string prefix for `Flow`s to be aggregated in electricity output. Default is "`Electricity output (GWh)-`".
#' @param heat_output a string that names the heat output `Flow`. Default is "`Heat output`". 
#' @param heat_output_prefix a string prefix for `Flow`s to be aggregated in heat output. Default is "`Heat output-`".
#' @param .rownum the name of a column created (and destroyed) internally by this function. 
#'        The `.rownum` column temporarily holds row numbers for internal calculations.
#'        The `.rownum` column is deleted before returning.
