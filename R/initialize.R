#' Load IEA data from an extended enegy balances csv file
#'
#' This function reads an IEA extended energy balances file and
#' converts it to a data frame with appropriately-labelled columns.
#' One of `iea_file` or `text` must be specified, but not both.
#' The first line of `iea_file` or `text`
#' is expected to start with `expected_start_1st_line`, and
#' the second line is expected to start with `expected_2nd_line_start`, and
#' it may have any number of commas appended.
#' (The extra commas might come from opening and re-saving the file in Excel.)
#' If those conditions are not met, execution is halted, and
#' an error message is given.
#' 
#' This function is designed to work even as more years are added
#' in columns at the right of `.iea_file`, 
#' because column names in the output are constructed from the first two lines of `iea_file` 
#' (which contain years and country, flow, product information).
#' 
#' The IEA data have indicators for 
#' not applicable values ("`x`") and for
#' unavailable values ("`..`"). 
#' (See "World Energy Balances: Database Documentation (2018 edition)" at
#' <http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/worldbal_documentation.pdf>.)
#' `R` has three concepts that could be used for "`x`" and "`..`":
#' `0` would indicate value known to be zero.
#' `NULL` would indicate an undefined value.
#' `NA` would indicate a value that is unavailable.
#' In theory, mapping from the IEA's indicators to `R` should proceed as follows:
#' "`..`" (unavailable) in the IEA data would be converted to `NA` in `R`.
#' "`x`" (not applicable) in the IEA data would be converted to `0` in `R`.
#' "`NULL`" would not be used.
#' However, the IEA are not consistent with their coding. 
#' In some places "`..`" is used for not applicable values
#' (e.g., World Anthracite supply in 1971). 
#' World Anthracite supply in 1971 is actually not applicable, because Anthracite was
#' classified under "Hard coal (if no detail)" in 1971.
#' On the other hand, "`..`" is used for data in the most recent year 
#' when those data have not yet been incorporated into the database. 
#' In the face of IEAâ€™s inconsistencies, 
#' the only rational way to proceed is to convert 
#' both "`x`" and "`..`" to "`0`"
#' in this function.
#' 
#' The data frame returned from this function is not ready to be used in R, 
#' because rows are not unique.
#' To further prepre the data frame for use, call `augment_iea_data()`,
#' passing the output of this function in the `.iea_df` argument of `augment_iea_data()`.
#'
#' @param .iea_file a string containing the path to a .csv file of extended energy balances from the IEA
#' @param text a character string that can be parsed as IEA extended energy balances. 
#'        (This argument is useful for testing.)
#' @param expected_1st_line_start the expected start of the first line of `iea_file`. Default is "`,,TIME`".
#' @param expected_2nd_line_start the expected start of the second line of `iea_file`. Default is "`COUNTRY,FLOW,PRODUCT`".
#' @param year_colname_pattern a regex that identifies columns with year titles. 
#'        Default is "`^\\d*$`" which identifies columns whose names are exclusively digits.
#' @param missing_data a string that identifies missing data. Default is "`..`".
#'        Entries of "`missing_data`" are coded as `0`` in output.
#' @param not_applicable_data a string that identifies not-applicable data.
#'        Entries of "`not_applicable_data`" are coded as `0` in output.

#' Augment an IEA data frame
#' 
#' This function prepares an IEA data frame created by [iea_df()] for use in R.
#' 
#' This function solves several problems.
#' The first problem is that metadata in the `COUNTRY`, `FLOW`, and `PRODUCT`
#' collumns of an IEA data table are not unique.
#' To solve this problem, two additional columns are added: `Ledger.side` and `Flow.aggregation.point`.
#' `Ledger.side` can be one of "`Supply`" or "`Consumption`", corresponding to the top or bottom of the IEA's tables, respectively.
#' `Flow.aggregation.point` indicates the next level of aggregation for these data. 
#' `Flow.aggregation.point` can be one of 
#' "`Total primary energy supply`", "`Transformation processes`", "`Energy industry own use`", or "`TFC compare`"
#' on the `Supply` side of the ledger.
#' On the `Consumption` side of the ledger, `Flow.aggregation.point` can be one of 
#' "`Industry`", "`Transport`", "`Other`", or "`Non-energy use`".
#' The second problem is that the countries are given by their (long) full name. 
#' To solve this problem, the country column is filled with 2-letter ISO abbreviations.
#'
#' @param .iea_df a data frame produced by the [iea_df()] function
#' @param ledger_side the name of the ledger side column. Default is "`Ledger.side`".
#' @param flow_aggregation_point the name of the flow aggregation point column. Default is "`Flow.aggregation.point`".
#' @param country the name of the country column in `.iea_df`. Default is "`COUNTRY`".
#' @param flow the name of the flow column in `.iea_df`. Default is "`FLOW`".
#' @param country the name of the country column in `.iea_df`. Default is "`COUNTRY`".
#' @param losses the string that indicates losses in the `flow` column. Default is "`Losses`".
#' @param supply the string that indicates supply in the `ledger_side` column. Default is "`Supply`".
#' @param consumption the string that indicates consumption in the `ledger_side` column. Default is "`Consumption`".
#' @param .rownum the name of a column created (and destroyed) internally by this function. 
#'        The `.rownum` column temporarily holds row numbers for internal calculations.
#'        The `.rownum` column is deleted before returning.
