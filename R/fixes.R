#' Fix Ghana Primary solid biofuels data from 1991 through 1999
#' 
#' Ghana's Primary solid biofuels data show a very large and dramatic decline from 1999 to 2000.
#' This decline is due to new survey data being used for the 2000 data.  
#' When we look at the PSB data on a per-capita basis, it is clear that 
#' a near-constant PSB/capita value was used to extrapolate per-capita usage in the late 1990s.
#' When new survey data became available for the 2000 reporting year, 
#' the per-capita consumption of PSB obviously changed.  
#' Our approach to this problem is to smooth out the really big peak in PSB consumption 
#' by reducing the per-capita consumption of PSB, starting in 1991.
