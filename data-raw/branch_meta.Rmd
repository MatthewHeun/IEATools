## Purpose
  
This file (data-raw/branch_meta.Rmd) describes branches in this repository.
It will help us keep track of what we are doing and why.
The file lives in the `data-raw` directory, so it is not part of the package.

Information in this file supports my code development strategy,
which can be found in my
[github repository](https://github.com/MatthewHeun/DevelopmentStrategies).
