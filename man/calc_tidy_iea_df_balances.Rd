\item{.tidy_iea_df}{an IEA-style data frame containing a \code{ledger_side}, \code{product},
\code{flow}, and energy rate (\code{e_dot}) columns along with
grouping columns, typically \code{Country}, \code{Year}, \code{Product}, etc.
a \code{Ledger.side} column.}

\item{ledger_side}{the name of the column in \code{.tidy_iea_data}
that contains ledger side information (a string). Default is "\code{Ledger.side}".}

\item{e_dot}{the name of the column in \code{.tidy_iea_data}
that contains energy flow data. Default is "\code{E.dot}".}

\item{units}{the name of the colum in \code{.tidy_iea_data}
that contains the units for the energy flow data. Default is "\code{Units}".}

\item{supply}{the identifier for supply data in the \code{ledger_side} column (a string).
Default is "\code{Supply}".}

\item{consumption}{the identifier for consumption data in the \code{ledger_side} column (a string).
Default is "\code{Consumption}".}

\item{supply_sum}{the name of a new column that will contain the sum of all supply for that group.
Default is "\code{supply_sum}".}

\item{consumption_sum}{the name of a new column that will contain the sum of all consumption for that group.
Default is "\code{consumption_sum}".}

\item{supply_minus_consumption}{the name of a new column that will contain the difference between supply and consumption for that group.
Default is "\code{supply_minus_consumption}".}

\item{balance_OK}{the name of a new logical column that tells whether a row's energy balance is OK.
Default is "\code{balance_OK}".}

\item{tol}{if the difference between supply and consumption is greater than \code{tol},
\code{balance_OK} will be set to \code{FALSE}. Default is \code{1e-6}.}

\description{
It is important to know whether energy flows are balanced before
proceeding with further analyses.
This function calculates energy balances
by groups in \code{.tidy_iea_df}.
So be sure to group \code{.tidy_iea_df} by appropriate variables
before calling this function.
Grouping should \emph{definitely} be done on the \code{Product} column.
Typically, grouping is also done on
\code{Country}, \code{Year}, \code{Energy.type}, \code{Last.stage}, etc. columns.
Grouping should \emph{not} be done on the \code{Flow} column.
To test whether all balances are OK,
use the \code{\link[=tidy_iea_df_balanced]{tidy_iea_df_balanced()}} function.
}
\details{
Supply side and consumption side energy flows are aggregated to a
\code{supply_sum} and a \code{consumption_sum} column.
There are two possibilities:
\enumerate{
\item A Product appears only on the supply side,
because it is completely transformed before reaching the consumption side of the ledger.
In this case, the \code{consumption_sum} column will have an
\code{NA} value, and the \code{supply_minus_consumption} column
will also have an \code{NA} value.
\item A Product appears on both the supply and the demand sides of the ledger
and, therefore, is not \code{NA} in the \code{consumption_sum} column and the
\code{supply_minus_consumption} column.
The column \code{balance_OK} is calculated as follows:
\item For the first situation, \code{consumption_sum} will be \code{0} (within \code{tol})
if the Product is balanced and
\code{balance_OK} will have a value of \code{TRUE}.
If not, \code{balance_OK} will have a value of \code{FALSE}.
\item In the second situation, the difference between \code{supply_sum} and \code{consumption_sum} is calculated
(\code{supply_minus_consumption}).
If the product is balanced,
\code{supply_minus_consumption} will be \code{0} (within \code{tol})
and \code{balance_OK} will be \code{TRUE}.
If not, \code{balance_OK} will be \code{FALSE}.
