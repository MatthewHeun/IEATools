\description{
The extended energy balance data from the IEA includes
"Energy industry own use" (EIOU) for many transformation processes.
Unfortunately, in some cases
the EIOU flows into industries that aren't included in transformation processes.
For example, "Electricity" is consumed by
"Own use in electricity, CHP and heat plants",
which is not a transformation process.
We have to make some decisions to ensure that
EIOU is routed to actual transformation processes.
See details for a list of changes made to the \code{.tidy_iea_df} data frame.
}
\details{
The following changes are made to the \code{.tidy_iea_df} data frame:
\enumerate{
\item EIOU classified as \code{own_use_elect_chp_heat} is sent to \code{main_act_producer_elect}.
\item EIOU classified as \code{pumped_storage} is sent to \code{main_act_producer_elect}.
\item EIOU classified as \code{nuclear_industry} is sent to \code{main_act_producer_elect}.
\item EIOU classified as \code{non_spec_energy} is sent to \code{nonspecenergy_reclassify}.
}

After the changes are made, reassigned EIOU may double-up pre-existing EIOU.
For example, a country may already have "Electricity" EIOU flowing into "Main activity producer electricity plants".
It may also have EIOU flowing into "Nuclear industry".
When we switch the EIOU flow into "Nuclear industry" into "Main activity producer electricity plants",
we now have two rows of electricity EIOU into "Main activity producer electricity plants".
To avoid double rows, all like rows are summed before returning.
