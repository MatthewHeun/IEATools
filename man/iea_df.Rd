\arguments{
\item{.iea_file}{a string containing the path to a .csv file of extended energy balances from the IEA}

\item{text}{a character string that can be parsed as IEA extended energy balances.
(This argument is useful for testing.)}

\item{expected_1st_line_start}{the expected start of the first line of \code{iea_file}. Default is "\code{,,TIME}".}

\item{expected_2nd_line_start}{the expected start of the second line of \code{iea_file}. Default is "\code{COUNTRY,FLOW,PRODUCT}".}

\item{year_colname_pattern}{a regex that identifies columns with year titles.
Default is "\code{^\\d*$}" which identifies columns whose names are exclusively digits.}

\item{missing_data}{a string that identifies missing data. Default is "\code{..}".
Entries of "\code{missing_data}" are coded as `0`` in output.}

\item{not_applicable_data}{a string that identifies not-applicable data.
Entries of "\code{not_applicable_data}" are coded as \code{0} in output.}

\description{
This function reads an IEA extended energy balances file and
converts it to a data frame with appropriately-labelled columns.
One of \code{iea_file} or \code{text} must be specified, but not both.
The first line of \code{iea_file} or \code{text}
is expected to start with \code{expected_start_1st_line}, and
the second line is expected to start with \code{expected_2nd_line_start}, and
it may have any number of commas appended.
(The extra commas might come from opening and re-saving the file in Excel.)
If those conditions are not met, execution is halted, and
an error message is given.
}
\details{
This function is designed to work even as more years are added
in columns at the right of \code{.iea_file},
because column names in the output are constructed from the first two lines of \code{iea_file}
(which contain years and country, flow, product information).

The IEA data have indicators for
not applicable values ("\code{x}") and for
unavailable values ("\code{..}").
(See "World Energy Balances: Database Documentation (2018 edition)" at
\url{http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/worldbal_documentation.pdf}.)
\code{R} has three concepts that could be used for "\code{x}" and "\code{..}":
\code{0} would indicate value known to be zero.
\code{NULL} would indicate an undefined value.
\code{NA} would indicate a value that is unavailable.
In theory, mapping from the IEA's indicators to \code{R} should proceed as follows:
"\code{..}" (unavailable) in the IEA data would be converted to \code{NA} in \code{R}.
"\code{x}" (not applicable) in the IEA data would be converted to \code{0} in \code{R}.
"\code{NULL}" would not be used.
However, the IEA are not consistent with their coding.
In some places "\code{..}" is used for not applicable values
(e.g., World Anthracite supply in 1971).
World Anthracite supply in 1971 is actually not applicable, because Anthracite was
classified under "Hard coal (if no detail)" in 1971.
On the other hand, "\code{..}" is used for data in the most recent year
when those data have not yet been incorporated into the database.
In the face of IEAâ€™s inconsistencies,
the only rational way to proceed is to convert
both "\code{x}" and "\code{..}" to "\code{0}"
in this function.

The data frame returned from this function is not ready to be used in R,
because rows are not unique.
To further prepre the data frame for use, call \code{augment_iea_data()},
passing the output of this function in the \code{.iea_df} argument of \code{augment_iea_data()}.
