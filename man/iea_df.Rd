\title{Load IEA data from an extended enegy balances csv file}
\usage{
iea_df(
  .iea_file = NULL,
  text = NULL,
  expected_1st_line_start = ",,TIME",
  expected_2nd_line_start = "COUNTRY,FLOW,PRODUCT",

}
\arguments{
\item{.iea_file}{a string containing the path to a .csv file of extended energy balances from the IEA.
Default is the path to a sample IEA file provided in this package.}

\item{text}{a character string that can be parsed as IEA extended energy balances.
(This argument is useful for testing.)}

\item{expected_1st_line_start}{the expected start of the first line of \code{iea_file}. Default is ",,TIME".}

\item{expected_2nd_line_start}{the expected start of the second line of \code{iea_file}. Default is "COUNTRY,FLOW,PRODUCT".}

\item{expected_simple_start}{the expected starting of the first line of \code{iea_file}. Default is the value of \code{expected_2nd_line_start}.
Note that \code{expected_simple_start} is sometimes encountered in data supplied by the IEA.
Furthermore, \code{expected_simple_start} could be the format of the file when somebody "helpfully" fiddles with
the raw data from the IEA.}

\item{missing_data}{a string that identifies missing data. Default is "\code{..}".
Entries of \code{missing_data} are coded as `0`` in output.}

\item{not_applicable_data}{a string that identifies not-applicable data. Default is "x".
Entries of \code{not_applicable_data} are coded as \code{0} in output.}

\item{confidential_data}{a string that identifies confidential data. Default is "c".
Entries of \code{confidential_data} are coded as \code{0} in output.}

\item{estimated_year}{a string that identifies an estimated year.
Default is "E".
E.g., in "2014E", the "E" indicates that data for 2014 are estimated.
Data from estimated years are removed from output.}

\value{
a data frame containing the IEA extended energy balances data
}
\description{
This function reads an IEA extended energy balances file and
converts it to a data frame with appropriately-labeled columns.
One of \code{iea_file} or \code{text} must be specified, but not both.
The first line of \code{iea_file} or \code{text}
is expected to start with \code{expected_start_1st_line}, and
the second line is expected to start with \code{expected_2nd_line_start}, and
it may have any number of commas appended.
(The extra commas might come from opening and re-saving the file in Excel.)
Alternatively, the file may start with \code{expected_simple_start}.
If none of these conditions are not met, execution is halted, and
an error message is provided.
Files should have a return character at the end of their final line.
}
\details{
This function is designed to work even as more years are added
in columns at the right of \code{.iea_file},
because column names in the output are constructed from the header line(s) of \code{.iea_file}
(which contain years and country, flow, product information).

The IEA data have indicators for
not applicable values ("\code{x}") and for
unavailable values ("\code{..}").
(See "World Energy Balances: Database Documentation (2018 edition)" at
\url{http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/worldbal_documentation.pdf}.)
\code{R} has three concepts that could be used for "\code{x}" and "\code{..}":
\code{0} would indicate value known to be zero.
\code{NULL} would indicate an undefined value.
\code{NA} would indicate a value that is unavailable.
In theory, mapping from the IEA's indicators to \code{R} should proceed as follows:
"\code{..}" (unavailable) in the IEA data would be converted to \code{NA} in \code{R}.
"\code{x}" (not applicable) in the IEA data would be converted to \code{0} in \code{R}.
"\code{NULL}" would not be used.
However, the IEA are not consistent with their coding.
In some places "\code{..}" (indicating unavailable) is used for not applicable values,
e.g., World Anthracite supply in 1971.
(World Anthracite supply in 1971 is actually not applicable, because Anthracite was
classified under "Hard coal (if no detail)" in 1971.)
On the other hand, "\code{..}" is used for data in the most recent year
when those data have not yet been incorporated into the database.
In the face of IEAâ€™s inconsistencies,
the only rational way to proceed is to convert
both "\code{x}" and "\code{..}" in the IEA files to "\code{0}" in the output data frame
from this function.
Furthermore, confidential data (coded by the IEA as "\code{c}") is also interpreted as \code{0}.
(What else can we do?)

The data frame returned from this function is not ready to be used in R,
because rows are not unique.
To further prepare the data frame for use, call \code{\link[=augment_iea_df]{augment_iea_df()}},
passing the output of this function to the \code{.iea_df} argument of \code{\link[=augment_iea_df]{augment_iea_df()}}.
