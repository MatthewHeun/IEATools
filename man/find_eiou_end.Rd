\title{Find the point where Energy industry own use ends}
\usage{
find_eiou_end(
  .ctry_tbl,
  flow = IEATools::iea_cols$flow,
  non_specified,
  losses = IEATools::tfc_compare_flows$losses
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.ctry_tbl}{a country's IEA data frame}

\item{flow}{See \code{IEATools::iea_cols$flow}.}

\item{non_specified}{the name of non-specified in the flow column}

\item{losses}{See \code{IEATools::tfc_compare_flows}.}
}
\value{
a pair of integers representing the rows that straddle
the split between Energy industry own use and Losses.
The first integer is the last row of Energy industry own use.
}
\description{
Given a country's IEA extended energy balance data frame,
find the row numbers that represent the transition between
the Energy industry own use and Losses (a TFC compare flow).
}
\details{
Arguments should be supplied by the calling function.

An error is given if this function fails to find the location of the split between
