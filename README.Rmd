# IEATools


## Statement of need

Extended World Energy Balance (EWEB) data from the
[International Energy Agency (IEA)](http://www.iea.org) (IEA) 
are indispensable for societal energy analysis and
societal exergy analysis (SEA).
However, 

* the EWEB data are not available native in the `R` data frame format;
* as distributed, the EWEB data are definitely not 
  [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf); and 
* the EWEB are not in physical supply-use table (PSUT) format
  proposed by [@Heun:2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

`IEATools` provides functions to address the above needs.


## Installation

<!-- You can install a recent development version of `IEATools` from github with: -->
You can install `IEATools` from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install devtools if not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MatthewHeun/IEATools")
# To build vignettes locally, use
devtools::install_github("MatthewHeun/IEATools", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## History

The functions in this package were used in 
[Heun et al. [-@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

Permission to distribute IEA extended energy balance data
for two years and two countries was obtained 
by Matthew Kuperus Heun from Nick Johnstone of the IEA
during a phone call at 11 AM on Mon, 3 June 2019.
